The Android Pizza Ordering App project entails the development of a mobile application focused on facilitating pizza orders based on the functional requirements outlined in Pizza by Patel. The app mandates adherence to coding standards and academic integrity policies, emphasizing the use of essential UI elements such as Toast, AlertDialog, ImageView, Spinner, and ListView. Key features include the implementation of a RecyclerView to display a diverse range of specialty pizzas, each customizable with quantity, size, and extra sauce/cheese options. The project necessitates the incorporation of at least two Android Activities with associated layout files, emphasizing the use of the "Singleton" design pattern for global data sharing. Additionally, developers must address text warnings by defining all display texts in the string.xml resource file and provide a distinct launcher icon for the Pizza by Patel app. Rigorous testing is essential, with point deductions for unmet functional requirements, uncaught exceptions, or faulty behaviors, reinforcing the importance of delivering a robust and user-friendly pizza ordering application.
